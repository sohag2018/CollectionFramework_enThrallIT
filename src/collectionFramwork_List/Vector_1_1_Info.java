/*
 implements the List interface
uses a dynamic array
different types of value
*Vector increments 100% capacity
*synchronized-1 thread at a time
* and contains many methods that are not the part of Collection framework.


Commonly used methods:
1.boolean add(Object obj): -> true if the specified element is added  successfully into the Vector, otherwise it returns false.
2.void add(int index, Object obj):
3.boolean addAll(Collection c) This method appends all of the elements
in the specified Collection to the end of this Vector. –we can copy ArrlyList value
4. boolean addAll(int index, Collection c) This method inserts all of the elements in the specified Collection into this Vector at the specified.
5.void clear() This method removes all of the elements from this vector
6.Object clone() This method returns a clone of this vector
7. boolean contains(Object o): This method returns true if this vector contains the specified element.
8.void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity): This method increases the capacity of this vector, if necessary, to ensure that it can hold at least the number of components specified by the minimum capacity argument .
9. Object get(int index):This method returns the element at the specified position in this Vector
10. int indexOf(Object o): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this vector, or -1 if this vector does not contain the element.
11. boolean isEmpty(): This method tests if this vector has no components
