Map ---> Interface
implemented class : HashMap   LinkedHashMap  TreeHashMap


HashMap
********
A HashMap --->store items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type (e.g. a String).
One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value). 
It can store different types: String keys and Integer values, or the same type, like: String keys and String values

LinkedHashMap 
************
 
---> LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order.

LinkedHashMap is a Hash table and linked list implementation of the Map interface, 
with predictable iteration order. This implementation differs from HashMap 
in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. 
This linked list defines the iteration ordering, which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map (insertion-order). 


TreeMap
***********
TreeMap class is a red-black tree based implementation. 
It provides an efficient means of storing key-value pairs in sorted order.

---->Java TreeMap contains only unique elements.
Java TreeMap cannot have a null key but can have multiple null values.
Java TreeMap is non synchronized.
Java TreeMap maintains ascending order.
