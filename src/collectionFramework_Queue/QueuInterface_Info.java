 #Queue Interface
Queue interface maintains the first-in-first-out order. (FIFO)
It can be defined as an ordered list that is used to hold the elements which are about to be processed. 
There are various classes like PriorityQueue, Deque, and ArrayDeque which implements the Queue interface.

Queue interface can be instantiated as:
Queue<String> q1 = new PriorityQueue();  
Queue<String> q2 = new ArrayDeque();


PriorityQueue
PriorityQueue class implements the Queue interface
holds the elements or objects which are to be processed by their priorities
PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to be stored in the queue
)


Deque Interface
Deque interface extends the Queue interface. In Deque, we can remove and add the elements from both the side. Deque stands for a double-ended queue which enables us to perform the operations at both the ends.
