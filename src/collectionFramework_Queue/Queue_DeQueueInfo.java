/*
Since Deque is an interface, objects cannot be created of the type deque. We always need a class which extends this list in order to create an object. And also, after the introduction of Generics in Java 1.5, it is possible to restrict the type of object that can be stored in the Deque. This type-safe queue can be defined as:
Obj is the type of the object to be stored in Deque
Deque<Obj> deque = new ArrayDeque<Obj> ();
